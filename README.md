# Population History
## How it Works
This Python program uses the streamlit, pandas and sklearn libraries to train a decision tree regression model on a 
dataset of population data. Unfortunately, the dataset is too small to make future predictions. 

The streamlit library is used to create a user interface for the program. The Program references over 10,000 data 
entries collected over 55 years across 188 countries.
